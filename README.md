# My Portfolio

This is a portfolio that talks about who I am and showcases the projects that I've made so far. 

Features:
* Profile Picture
* Animations for the image thumbnails
* An about section talking about my web dev experience
* Each project has its own page with links for the GitHub repo and live demo on GitHub Pages
* All routing is done with Express

In order to view, you can download, open the folder in cmd (or equivalent) and type:

**npm install** and then, 

**npm start**

After that, you can open up localhost:3000 in the web browser and the website will be live on port 3000!

### Additional edits made to CSS:
* Transitions on the image thumbnails
* Changed background colour scheme
* Changed fonts to give a more creative look
